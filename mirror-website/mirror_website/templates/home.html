        <h1>Request a Mirror</h1>
        <p>
            We are always looking for new projects to mirror! If there's 
            something you'd like us to mirror, please open an issue with the 
            "Mirror Request" tag on our
            <a href="https://github.com/COSI-Lab/mirror/">GitHub repository.</a>
            The issue template includes instructions on what information we need
            to start syncing the mirror. If possible, rsync is preferred, but we
            can also sync over HTTP.
