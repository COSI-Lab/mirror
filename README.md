# mirror

Software for Clarkson University's open source mirror.

# Features
- All mirrors are configured in `config/sync/configs/mirrors.json`
- Sync scheduler to keep mirrors up to date
- Website with a list of mirrors and general info
- Live map of downloads

# Building

To build Mirror, make sure you have `git` and `docker` installed. Each module uses
builder containers with the proper tools, so you don't need to install anything extra.

Once you have docker installed, `git clone` this repository somewhere on your
machine, preferably `/opt/mirror`. At the repository root, run `make dev`. This will 
use the development docker compose configuration and run each module with the configs located in
the module's directory.

To configure some sensitive settings for modules, you will need to create a `.env` file.
`.env.example` includes some sane defaults for a *testing* environment. At the very least you should
change the `WEB_DJANGO_SECRET` before deploying. Docker *will* get upset if you don't define everything.

To emulate a production environment, make sure the directories `/storage` and `/var/log/mirror` exist.
Also, make sure to edit `mirrors.json` in `config/sync/configs/`. At this point you'll want to install and run
certbot to get HTTPS certificates for your domain. You can run `make certbot` to do this on any ubuntu host.
The production config will not work without certificates! We are working on addressing this.
Run `make prod` to use the production docker compose configuration and run each module
as if it was running on Mirror. 

We currently use the development configuration on our personal machines and
the production configuration on a test server. Both are frequently tested.

# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to Mirror, please create a branch/fork and open
a pull request with your changes. You can also create issues if you see
something can be improved. This opens up opportunities to others to make 
contributions too. If you're not sure where to start, documentation is always a
great place. If you need help or have questions about contributing, please

> # Aside: Project Goals
> 
> ## Modularity
> A modular Mirror allows us to write simple components that
> [Do One Thing and Do it Well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
> This eases the learning curve for younger students by allowing them to work
> in a familiar environment on small programs, while keeping the opportunity to
> learn about interactions between modules in a large software project open.
>
> Each module of Mirror should be assigned an easily describable purpose,
> for example:
>
> - The sync scheduler keeps our local mirrors synced with upstream mirrors.
>
> - The website serves pages to visitors of mirror.clarkson.edu.
>
> - The map module sends data from the metrics engine over a websocket, adding
>   approximate locations to it.
>
> ## Maintainability
>
> Mirror should be easy to maintain for future students. To make this possible,
> it should be documented, structured, and written in in a way that students who
> may have not yet taken higher-level CS classes can learn and contribute to.
>
> As such, mirror should be as plug-and-play as possible. Anything that can be containerized
> or otherwise abstracted should be. The goal of this is to make the project fully understandable
> by reading the source. No magic daemons configured on the host at 2AM on a weekend and never doccumented.
> Similarly the project should strive to be fully statically built. In an ideal case it would not be neccessary
> to download the full source and build it, and instead it could be pulled from a prebuilt container image with 
> just a few configuration files on the host.
>
> ## Community
>
> Contributing to Mirror's source code, documentation, and maintenance should be
> an experience that many students at COSI take part in. Knowledge about Mirror
> should be available both as documentation and as in-person help for 
> contributors.
>
> ## Free and Open Source Software
> 
> While Mirror's primary purpose is to run our open source mirror, it should be
> available to others who wish to mirror free and open source software. This 
> goes beyond just an open source license, Mirror should be designed with
> adaptability to different environments in mind.
